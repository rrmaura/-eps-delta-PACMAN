    "# \"Power\" calculations with Bayesian ($\\epsilon, \\delta$) - PACMAN\n",
    "\n",
    "#### By Roberto-Rafael Maura-Rivero and Sreevidya Ayyar\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook aims to provide some intuition on perfmorning power calculations if one was to switch from using an RCT to using the ($\\epsilon, \\delta$) - PACMAN Bandit algorithm for comparing several treatment arms in an experiment. \n",
    "\n",
    "First and foremost, recall the relevant definition of power: \n",
    "\n",
    "\"Suppose our parameter of interest is $\\theta$, the average treatment effect of a particular policy. Now, when performing a hypothesis test on this parameter, with specified null and alternative hypotheses (e.g. $H_0: \\theta = 0.3$ and $H_1: \\theta \\ne 0.3$), power is defined as one minus the probability of making a type 2 error.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{Power} = 1- P(\\text{fail to reject} H_0|H_A: \\theta \\ne 0.3) = P(\\text{reject} H_0|H_A: \\theta \\ne 0.3)$\n",
    "\n",
    "The difficulty of dealing with power is that the classical definition specifies conditioning on an infitite-dimensional set of possible alternative values for $\\theta$. When implementing power calculations therefore, it is standard practice to focus on a single alternative value of $\\theta$ at a time, i.e.:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{Power} = 1- P(\\text{fail to reject} H_0|H_A: \\theta = \\gamma) = P(\\text{reject} H_0|H_A: \\theta = \\gamma)$\n",
    "\n",
    "for $\\gamma \\in \\{0.1,.02,0.4,0.5\\}$. How to formulate a set of alternatives is generally up to the empirical researcher. One way could be to list values of $\\theta$ that the researcher would like to rule out. Another could be to rule out minimum detestable effects drawn from another, comparable experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our paper, we propose the use of a Bayesian multi-armed bandit algorithm as a way to pin down treatment focus for an RCT. Our algorithm proposes to roll-out multiple treatments simultaneously over sequential experiments, to identify the set of treatment arms that have the highest average treatment effect (with high probability). The intuition is as follows. Instead of conducting a possibly under-powered RCT with 6 treatment arms, we propose that experimenters conduct a pilot study of sequential experiments to identify the set of best-performing arms. Our multi-armed bandit algorithm can be used to conduct a small number of sequential experiments, each requiring much smaller sample sizes than a typical RCT, to identify say the treatment arm(s) with the highest average treatment effect which should be the focus of a larger-scale RCT.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our algorithm works as follows. In the first round of experimentation, we randomize 8 treatments. Our algorithm assesses the performance of each treatment and does two things. Firstly, it discards the 4 worst-performing treatment. This means in the next round, we will only randomize 4 treatments. Secondly, our algorithm uses the information gathered on remaining 4 best-performing treatments to decide how many people should be allocated to each treatment in the next round of the experiment. This is the \"Bayesian\" nature of our algorithm. From here, the algorithm enters into the second round of experimentation, where 4 treatments are randomized. Two are then discarded, and the third round of experimentation is designed only for the 2 remaining treatments. Based on the performance of these 2 treatments in this third round, the algorithm identified the best treatment arm.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are using this Bayesian multi-armed bandit algorithm though, what is the relevant notion of power? We believe it is not immediately obvious which object to care about, but here is one interpretation we have. Suppose we have 8 treatment arms; that is, 7 treatments and 1 control. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to test a very specific alternative hypothesis on the ATE of multiple treatments, e.g. \n",
    "\n",
    "$H: \\\\ \\theta_0 = 0, \\\\ \\theta_1 = 0.1,\\\\ \\theta_2 = 0.2,\\\\ \\theta_3 = 0.3,\\\\ \\theta_4 = 0.4,\\\\ \\theta_5 = 0.5,\\\\ \\theta_6 = 0.6,\\\\ \\theta_7 = 0.7$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can calculate the probability of \"type 2 error\" as the probability of returning the control as the best treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bandit Power = $Pr$(($\\epsilon, \\delta$)-PACMAN algorithm proposes the control as best treatment | $H$)"
